Should I start Working on a an enemy file or are the tilesets good?

you can work on an enemy file, just keep in mind the format for it and how it works. if you want i can show you how to add objects but rn im working on the tiles

Thats gas

ya; im currently working on collisions and stuff but eventually everything will go under a collision parent (collideable) 
so making enemies should be easy for you and austin hopefully? We'll see if it's any better in practice

P.S. These people are fake and im talking to myself
false

OH MY GOD I WISH HED SHUT UP
