# Super Mario 2

Welcome to the project known colloquially as Super Mario 2, one of the most ambitious, aspiring and pioneering serious projects devised of the 21st century. This project is only for the most formidable and demanding programmers who are most desperately anxiously and impatiently awaiting their next challenge, insistant on providing the upmost top notch programming quality and experience known to man. 

The intricacies of this project are almost indescribable, the conception of it coming from the mere thought of a challenge greater than scaling the highest mountain; The recreation of one of mankind's greatest achievements, the pinnacle of humanity itself. 

As this project uses copyrighted material, it may not have a true and adequate license, and it is therefore undecided what the future of this project holds, for it is also too powerful for the Github servers themselves, so the inevitability of the project's collapse is almost expected. However, it shall stay up for as long as it possibly can, as is but a mere experience in wait to be beholded by the mind's eye. 

"Super Mario 2" is programmed in the best programming language known to man, Python, a fork of Pithon devised by the great Monty Python himself, the creator of the holy grail and author of Jesus Christ. Python is not only the fastest language known to man, totaling at above 30x faster than any possible competitor, but it is also widely used in data science, and has the most intuitive and amazing syntax known to man. It is an objective strength of the language, and it was a no brainer, given the choice was that or to program it solely in assembly, for no other language would be able to contain the raw power of the executable file of such an anticipated sequel.

> [!Note]
> This Project requires a computer that is able to calculate advanced procedures with, minimum of 256 processors and 32 preprocessors, and is estimated to require 32 gigabytes of ram for the startup alone. Along with these requirements, the mental fortitude required to adequately run this project is immense, and it is not recommended for the average consumer. Discretion is advised.
